							<h1>Testing</h1>
							 <p>The prototype of the app doesnâ€™t have much functionality without the database so we were unable to test the app for any major bugs. Proto.io gives us a limited ability to test some of the buttons to make sure they are going to the right places. If we were given more time to complete the project, or give the project to another group. The way we would test the project is by asking users to test the project. The target group for the test would be experienced testers to go through and try the bug out, if we are unable to get experienced testers then we would get someone with a tradie background to try and make their job listing and other things. The reason why we would get someone with a tradie background is because that is the type of people that would most likely be using this app once it is released. We would only require around 3-4 people to test the product in its late stages to iron out any of the major or minor bugs found. The amount of testing required is not that much in comparison to other projects as it is very straightforward and not very code based. The way we designed the app is to make sure it is user friendly and very simplistic so that even someone not tech savvy could use it.</p>
