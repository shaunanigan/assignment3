							<h1>Aims</h1>
							 <p>The aim of this project is to create a fully operational website and app that is user friendly and smooth. The point of this project is to bring the workers together into one space where they are easily able to communicate with potential employers and are able to filter down what type of jobs are available at the moment. To successfully complete this project within the given time frame, we have created goals for each other to make sure we are not falling behind on the deadlines. The goals we have set are fairly straight forward, the app is one of the main things for us so we have put that at the top of the list, the website would be second after and then finally connecting them together would be the final goal.</p>
							 <p>The first goal was making the website itself. This goal and the app are placed on the highest because we were able to separate our group into two subgroups so we could work on two things at once. It doesn’t take all of us to work on the app so most of us were working on the website. The reason this goal was placed as high priority as the app was because this is where we would be showcasing most of the project's ideas and everything else. Without a functional website, we would not be able to showcase most of our completed work so everything would be for nothing. If we were really running out of time and we had to choose between our top two goals, we would probably have to put a hold on the app to finish the website as it does take priority over that.</p>
							 <p>The second goal of the app is to make it a functional app in the first place. The design aspect is not as important for the goal because it can be done later on. Getting the skeleton of the app and making sure everything connects up and moves as it was intended to do so was our top priority. If we were unable to finish the whole app then we would be willing to let some of the design go unfinished. There are some things that we were unable to do with making the app and one of those was actually storing the saved data for the app. We understand that we were only making a prototype so having the storage working was not really important. The reason why we placed this as one of the highest priority is that having this app working would showcase the project idea well in terms of functionality and showcasing the base idea.</p>
							 <p>Our third main goal was being able to connect between the app and the website itself. The way we would do this is having a similar design pattern that goes through both which shouldn’t be a challenge as we had already found similar designs. The main problem would be having an account on the website link up to the app and being able to switch between them. This part of the project was placed lower than the others because we simply didn’t know how to do that in the first place and if we did run out of time, we would just drop the idea. If we didn’t end up doing it, we would still be able to show the aim of the project through the prototype. Being able to create an account is important but in its early stages, there are far more important components that need to be created.</p>
