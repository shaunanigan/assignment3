							<p><b>About Our Project</b></p>
							<p>A basic app to have potential employees submit their interest to work. Instead of employers advertising jobs, this would be a place for people to describe themselves and upload a resume for potential employers to reach out to people, instead of the other way around. Could include anything from slight interests in new careers or people looking for a professional change, with the employee then holding the power to find work.</p>
							<p>Being an employer in the trade industry, finding the right people to employee is easily the hardest aspect of what I do. Being a plasterer is not a job that I can physically do on my own, so finding people (in particular, reliable people) is extremely frustrating. Every current tradie that I interact with at the moment has way more work than they can handle, and are all struggling to find people to work. This platform can have potential employees that want to work (even with a spare couple of days), advertise direct to people looking for workers. It is worth noting that the technology exists, for example: https://gigsmart.com/hire-workers/temporary-staffing/ is a great website for people looking for work. However nothing is specified to either trade based work and especially apprentices. Many apprentices don’t know how to even apply for a trade job, let alone find one. So this app would hopefully allow young people looking for a trade to put themselves out there and let the trades come to them. Rather than apply for job after job</p>
							<p>So the way this would work would be slightly the same as something like seek.com. However this is something that can be powered by people looking for work rather than jobs being advertised. Let's say for example that me being a plasterer, I had a couple of spare days from a job not being ready. I can simply advertise on a site, or app in this case, where I can say… Looking for work. Need a few days. Professional qualified plasterer with own transport, and have employers contact me directly. Specialised trades are always having jobs fall through before they can organise extra work, especially if they themselves have full time subcontractors which can lead to groups of trades people out of work for any amount of days. This sort of app would be so useful for short term working positions which can always lead to more permanent jobs. People connecting with people.</p>
							<p>This can also be used for full time positions, in particular, apprentices looking for a start in a trade. As a lot of young people would definitely understand, it’s a difficult time trying to decide what you’d like to do career wise for the rest of your working life. And sure it doesn’t have to be a permanent thing, but if a 17 or 18 year old kid wants to leave school and start a trade he/she can express his/her interests to this app and get some employers to engage him/her. Example would be: Hi my name is ______ and I’m looking for a trade. My interests include being outside, cars, and getting my hands dirty. With the potential of maybe say a Mechanic looking for an apprentice able to get in touch straight away with them for a trial.</p>
							<p>Seems as though this could be a very simple app to build using simple tools and work the same as something like HiPages app in real time. Many potential people are losing work or looking for new jobs without having to apply for job after job to get knocked back. Employers can accept people for a test and people can let the work come to them. Potentially saving employers down time on looking for people to help them on jobs. A database (or at very least at database schema) would definitely be needed. A website would also have to be built to go along with the app. As the website would be a lot more user friendly for uploading resumes. Something simple using HTML or javascript with the database full of potential customers can very much be achievable. However the app would need to be built to link to the webpage. 1 such example is my current xero business account. I use the webpage online for the majority of my work, however the app is convenient for doing things on the go when I don't have access to my computer. It doesn't have all the same features of the website but there is enough functionality to get by day to day using my phone on the go. I don’t think any of us have experience with building an actual app, but there are some step by step guides on how to build one from scratch. We can definitely make a simple website to link such an app though. The only flaw with this particular app is the more people involved, the better the experience. So having only 1 or 2 people to start with, employers would find that difficult to find workers. So the more people involved the better.</p>
							<p>Based on my current experience, I find that a lot of the time I have my guys not show up for a day or 2 because they have been sick or, had car issues from first thing in the morning, and not come in. Happens all the time. However my jobs still need to be done and I have deadlines to meet. If I have an app with a potential plasterer looking for a few days work, I can then engage them to start immediately with the potential for a new worker, or keep the contact for future slow work weeks. Developing a network of reliable tradespersons. That in turn looks great for clients. Having neat reliable workers is a massive tick for all my clients. Therefore creating new work opportunities with the right people moving forward. Which, like I have said, is easily the hardest part of my job.</p>
							<p>The technology exists so that’s the easy part. Essentially you will need a form of app builder or developer which can then work in real time. Something along the lines of Appy Pie or Shoutem would be a great place to start without any experience in app development. Simple step by step guides to build exactly what you want, without the need for coding to start. Would then need advertising agencies and such to then advertise your ad through social media to gain attention.</p>
							<p>The overall outcome for this idea would be putting people, in particular, trades people who are looking for work into jobs on a quick turnaround. The overall idea would be developing networks of reliable tradespeople to short term positions when required. Or find young people new careers without having to apply for an endless supply of job advertisements. In turn the employers can find people short term, or get people with certain interests to start an apprenticeship they may not have thought about in the first place.</p>
