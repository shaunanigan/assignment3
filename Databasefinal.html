Database Design - Let Me Work

   	  <p>
   	 The app Let Me Work  will be relying heavily on databases and critical information storage for users to input and obtain data. All users regardless of being a worker or a Employer will have their data securely stored in our locally created database for fast and convenient data access. 

To allow Employers to communicate their available jobs with workers and workers to express interest for jobs with the desired skills a database and computer generated SQL will be utilized to increase productivity and reduce delay of displaying information to workers. Users skills and qualifications will determine what jobs will be shown to them and what jobs they will be allowed to apply for.

   	 All information that is provided by either a worker or an employer will be key information that can uniquely identify a user and class them into different categories which will impact what information that is supplied to other workers and employers. 

A good database design is required for the app to function smoothly and the desired data to be displayed to each end user. The database diagrams below have been designed specifically to allow quick access by using a simplistic design that computer generated SQL queries would not struggle with.

This Schema below was used to create the basis of the Relationship Diagram that the database will be based on. The Underlined words represent the primary key and the ‘*’ represents the foreing key in the table that links to another table.

All these diagrams will be used to design the database. Since the database will be accessed by potentially thousands of users per hour in peak times a non-traditional NOSQL database will be used to store all the information. A Nontraditional database can store more information in it than a traditional database for cheaper meaning that it'll be more cost effective. As well as the ability to store more information non traditional databases can also have more unique inputs that aren't pre defined. This allows users to enter key skills that may not already be already input into the database. By making this database more flexible it prevents more errors from occurring and means the app will be less likely to have bugs and issues. With predefined SQL commands that users can select through the app GUI via buttons and dropdowns (EG. Filters) the database will be effective and efficient for this application. For this application the above database will be used for the most efficient functionality of the app.
