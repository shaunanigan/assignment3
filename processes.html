							<h1>Group Processes and Communication</h1>
							 <p>What we have learned from the previous assignment is that during the start of our project, we would be having weekly meetings outside of class on Wednesdays that meeting again on Thursdays during class time, so we would be meeting 2 times every week at the minimum. As the project goes along and we know what we are doing, we would meet 1-2 more times extra a week to make sure we are on track and everything is going smoothly. During these meetings, we would talk about what work we have done and to get ideas on what to improve on and what to add or remove.  We would all like to meet in person but sadly due to the covid-19 lockdown, we were unable to meet in person and brainstorm ideas together. We think that this issue has been a factor of some setbacks because we are not familiar with working online in a team environment. The main communication program that we will be using is microsoft teams, the reason for this is because it is easy to record meetings for reference and it was recommended. Microsoft Teams is easy to navigate and to share work online so it has been our main type of communication.</p>
							 <p>In the event that a group member does not respond to our communication, we would first contact them privately to make sure they are okay and that if there are any problems. Most of the time when someone doesn’t turn up to our meetings they have a valid reason for doing so. If we do not hear back from them the second time then we start to raise possibilities of something going wrong. Contact them again and make sure we have a backup plan just in case someone drops out of the group midway into the project. The backup plan would simply be delegating their tasks equally among us to carry their workload so we don’t fall behind. We have had someone in our group drop out of the course without telling us in Assignment 2, so we have experience in working around that and acting decisely.</p>
