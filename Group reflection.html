I believe that we performed better than expected for this assignment. Although we were not completing tasks as early as we were originally hoping due to other assignments from different classes, I am happy with the work that we as a team were able to produce. We had more frequent meetings this time around, which was good because we were able to see where we were all at throughout the whole project. We also made the Google Docs page at the beginning of the assignment as opposed to towards the end, which really helped us to stay on task.</p>
							<p>Shaun JONES<br>The straun dog definitely took some control on this one. Everyone dropped the 13 dollar nachos and a tooheys red 30 can cube was there to pick up the pieces. Once the idea was in place the boys got cracking. Like a no scope kill shot from 100 yards away. The app was built with some tough times and finding the functionality was the largest part. The assignment in whole probably should have started a little earlier given the amount of information to put in was a lot larger than assignment 2. The boys all pitched in and we got something done I'm really proud of. Not like starting pokemon blue with bulbasaur, cause you're already down for a loss.</p>

This time around the group worked a lot more smoothly. Early on in the timeline of the project we quickly went through the basis of the assessment. We were quick to delegate tasks and get into working on them. Early on in the assignment we realised that some of the details we were including were either unnecessary or wrong. With our meetings that were held 1 to 2 times per week we were able to iron out any issues we had along with helping each other with any questions. Within the last week coming up to the submission of the assignment we all worked well with each other and put our heads down and smashed out the remaining parts of the assignments using teamwork and dedication, ending on a high note with our group.</p>

What went well in this group was our ability to easily communicate through teams and easily delegate tasks. Working on some of the feedback from assignment 2, we were able to maximise some of our time and work on the things we didnâ€™t do well before. Shaun had a great idea of what needed to be done for the project so everyone was on the same page all the time. Some of the things that we could have improved on was our time management, we had a very slow start on Assignment 3 because of many different factors that were out of our control but we managed to bounce back and get back on schedule. One thing I found surprising was that not once was someone lost on what they were doing, when someone was assigned a task then they knew how to get it done quite quickly. One thing that I learned about groups was that even though we were working all online, we were able to work in a team environment the whole time without being familiar with online teams. </p>

Although we had a somewhat slow start to the assignment, due to assignments being completed in other classes, the group has efficiently completed all the aspects of the assignment by the completion date. The communication between all the group members was easy, and everybody was on board to help complete the delegated tasks. A major improvement that could have been made within assignment 3 would be to balance the work more and not leave a bit of work towards the end.</p>
<p>Overall Group Reflection<br>
As a team, our main strengths were having good communication, with the minimum of meeting at least 2 times a week and at maximum, having 4 meetings a week, we were really able to maximise the tasks that needed to be done. The work ethic of each of the members was great when we all got together then things really came together and became completed. Understanding our team dynamics was something that we optimised by assigning tasks that people were good or keen at. The main weaknesses that we had while being a team was that our time management skills were very poor compared to the other assignment. On the previous assignment, we did leave some things to the last minute and that was something that we did not want to do again. Sadly due to our time management, we did leave some things in the final weeks but the majority of the things were completed before the weekend. In terms of contribution, no one was left out for the delegation of tasks and we believe that everyone contributed equally for the project.</p>
<p>Some things that we would do differently if we had the chance would definitely be having a roadmap of things to do and having small deadlines for each of the tasks, that way we could easily see what was finished and what needed to be done. This is a much better way to delegate tasks as the way we did it turned out to be harder to track and follow. Because we changed some of the tasks around, there might have been some confusion on what each of us were doing instead. Even though we did have a good team composition, we still had other assignments that were due earlier than this and even though this is a major assignment, some of our time was focused towards them instead. </p>
