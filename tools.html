							<h1>Tools and Technologies</h1>
							 <p>The tools and technologies that were used include proto.io, github and microsoft docs. The reason why we chose proto.io over other app making applications is because we tried another program called android studio. The reason why proto.io was chosen over android studio was because it was more easier to work with in comparison to android studio as it was more visual coding which made it easier to learn. Proto.io requires a subscription to use but allows a 14 day free trial. We were all using the trial but if we were to take it further, Shaun was willing to pay the subscription fee. The actual version of proto.io that was used for the app development was proto.io version 6.7.1. We used google docs to write all the content because when working in a team environment, it allowed us to make real time changes and for all of us to work together at the same time. Github was the easiest way for us to offload our work into a HTML website and allow us to see what has been updated so we can see we are on track. We had prior experience with Google docs and github from the previous assignment so it was the most comfortable for us. None of us had any experience working with app development so Shaun had to learn it from scratch.</p>
