							<h1>Scopes and Limits</h1>
							 <p>There are many limitations that have been placed on us in order to produce a semi-functional demo of our project idea. Since we’re all first year, first semester students, we have practically zero contributing IT skills and experience, meaning we have to learn a lot of the skills that we need to complete our project as we are doing it.</p>
							 <p>As we all have a lack of programming skills, we’re not likely to have a backend for our project. Given the time constraints, we are planning to get the app UI together with Proto.io and have functioning buttons that link to different parts of the app. However, in order to achieve some level of “presentable” functionality, we plan on linking web pages together using HTML for the design of the website. In terms of hosting, we will be hosting our webpage on GitHub. If we were to bring this to life in the real world, with a functional backend and information storage, this wouldn’t be applicable or practical. We would have to find our own way to host the website, which would either be difficult or would cost money as we would have to pay for a domain name and hosting.</p>
							 <p>Another limitation that is placed on us is the lack of additional devices for testing purposes. We each only have access to our primary window-based computers and our smartphones. If we were to, in theory, bring this application to life, we would have no way to test functionality on MacOS machines. In an ideal world, we would source out a physical MacOS machine for testing purposes however, due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, this is not possible.</p>
							 <p>Additionally due to the time constraints (and lack of artistic personalities) the design of the user interface might not be the prettiest looking, but we intend to have all the necessary features completed by submission and able to be demonstrated.</p>
