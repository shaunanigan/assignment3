							<h1>Plans and Processes</h1>
							 <p>The reason why our group chose Shauns project over everyone else's was because Shauns idea was practical, realistic and actually solved a real life problem. Our other projects weren’t bad but Shauns really stuck out and inspired us to work on it. Working through Assignment 2 on it, we understood the base ideas deeper when Shaun expanded on the idea and then finally we started planning the prototype. Shaun had a good idea of what he envisioned within the project so all we had to do was give him some feedback on how to accomplish it. We first thought that a Website wasn’t enough for this idea and that it did need an app to go with it because in the current times, everyone has a mobile phone.</p>
							 <p>The way we planned to complete this project within the set timeframe given was to split our group up to work on the website or the app. The reason why we did this was because the amount of time it takes to learn to create an app was not worth it for all of us to waste doing that. When we set our priorities, we placed the website and app on the top of the list as this is what would showcase the idea the most. We also prioritized functionality over the UI as we were only making a prototype. When we have reached the deadline, we should have a solid prototype of the app and a website showcasing the idea thoroughly with matching colours and logo design. Even if the app is not 100% functional, it should still be able to project our idea clearly. </p>
							 <p>After having some setbacks due to other assignments, with the delegation of set tasks, we took a more relaxed approach. With Shaun working away on the app solely, it gave us more time to work on the website content. Everyone’s set tasks have been changed to what needed to be done at the moment. Once we completed the mandatory things such as website content and html then we can start looking towards the extras that we wanted for the assignment. The reason we did this was just in case something happened, we would have the website and app completed.</p>
							 <p>We only had one major setback when working on this project and that was that sadly one of our members left the class without telling us. This was in the middle of assignment 2 when we were building on the project idea. We had our concerns when he did not start showing up to our weekly meetings but didn’t want to assume anything. We had delegated tasks the week before when he was present so we assumed that this work would be finished. After coming close to the due date and having no response from him, we had to work around and complete his work as well. We did have to do some of the work last minute but that is somewhat our fault because we put too much trust into our teammate. That was our only major setback when working on the project and sometimes we did have some minor setbacks with conflicting assignments and meeting our other class deadlines. When working on multiple assignments it can become a bit stressful so we fell behind schedule. Once our other class assessments were finalised we went back to work and tried to catch up on our schedule.</p>
							 <p>With Shaun having the experience of working as a plasterer, it is really beneficial for us because he knows exactly what is needed for the idea to work. He has asked for some opinions with the people he works with on what they would like on the app and this feedback is priceless. Having direct feedback from our target audience is not something that people can easily get and we are really thankful that we had this opportunity. There weren’t many major changes from the project plan that we faced as a group because we didn’t want to over complicate many things so things were kept rather simple. Everyone had an idea on what needed to be done and slowly worked towards that goal. Having the feedback from assignment 2 and having the ideas from the plasterers helped us form a good project plan.</p>
							 <p>Getting the project idea from just an idea on paper to working on how it will physically work was a bit of a challenge since we had to change our way of thinking. There are so many different aspects we had to think about from functionality to designing a logo and colour schemes. What helped us a lot was that Shaun did put a lot of thought into his project so we had a good idea of what he wanted done. The design idea for the website and app was to keep a minimalistic approach towards the colour schemes and match them through with the logo design. We didn’t need anything vibrant or abstract because it didn’t go with the idea. </p>
							 <p>With app development, considering that none of us had any prior experience working in an app development environment, it was quite daunting to create one from scratch. Having to learn to code and create something very new takes a lot of time and dedication so we decided to only have one or two people working on the application otherwise we wouldn’t get the website finished. When creating the app, we did come up with some troubles in terms of functionality because we didn’t know how to save anything. For example, if you wanted to sign up and create an account, we would need a database for that to be stored. This was a problem because accounts and passwords should be very secure and we did not know how to do that. We did have some small hiccups throughout the development but most of them were ironed out. One of the main things that we got working was the ability to directly send an email to an apprentice straight from the app, this was a major breakthrough as we had tried to implement this for a while.</p>
							 <p>When working on the app development, our first issue was which development studio did we want to use to create it. Like we said previously, with none of us having any experience making an app we decided to use Android studio. Android studio was very challenging considering it was very code based and not much visual coding. Android studio seemed to be designed for experienced developers and we did not have the time to learn all the features. Proto.io was something that Shaun found and it was very beginner friendly with a lot less coding and more visual aspects. Even though we could only get a trial for this studio, it was the perfect application for us to create our app. We were able to work in a team environment with all of us being able to develop on it at once and it was very easy to use.</p>
							 <p>After the first two assignments, all of us have been quite experienced with HTML and creating a website. Once we discussed and chose a nice template for the website, the main problem we came across would be having a database to save accounts. Another problem was that we wanted to sync the website and the app across both platforms but we simply just lack the experience to accomplish that. We understand that we are only creating the prototype for the project so not everything needs to be completed but we wanted to get as close as we could to the finished product.</p>
							 <p>Once the website and app have finished their development, we understand that this doesn’t mean the idea is finished. Just because we have an app and website doesn’t mean it will immediately take off and everyone will start using it. The main problem is that we rely on people to use the app for it to work. If no one uses the app then it is useless. There are many ways for us to get the app off the ground, first we will create multiple social media pages on different platforms to help promote the app. Using advertisements on social media with a select target audience is the most realistic way to get the idea moving. Our target audience would be apprentices because we find that they have a harder time finding work considering they are just starting out, if they had an app to help them it would be tremendous.</p>
							 <p>The main things we plan to complete if we had more time would be setting up a database for both the website and app. With the database, we would use something like SQLite with decent security. Having an instagram, facebook and twitter would be ideal where we can showcase the app to potential users. Fixing up the prototype of the app would include having the username update for each person signed in because right now it is static. We would want to have a working save option when adding information to your profile and to the jobs where it will update and you can see what you have written.</p>
							 <p>After 4-6 months of advertising, hopefully the popularity of the app will have a solid base where it can slowly expand. With Shaun being in the plastering business, he has some connections himself that might help get the app moving faster than if someone else was doing it. You don’t really need a large team to help manage the app once it is finished as there isn’t really much to do but having one person adjust and update the app to the user's preference would probably be ideal.</p>
