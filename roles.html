							<h1>Roles</h1>
							 <p>We have designated each person a different set of roles so each person has their delegated tasks. Michael and Shaun have been assigned to the app development and are working on the skeleton and design of the app. Crispin and Rhys have been assigned towards creating the content for the Website while Ethan has been assigned to the HTML development for the website. There isn’t really a reason why each person decided on their roles but it was more of a preference thing on what people wanted to do within the assignment. The roles haven’t been changed week to week as these are large tasks that will take the majority of the time. Once we have all finished our tasks, we will come together and help piece them together. We have assigned roles for the previous assignment and found that it does go well by making sure everyone is on the same page for what they are doing. Roles are important to the team dynamic and meeting deadlines because everyone has their set tasks that we all expect for them to finish. Even though everyone has set tasks, it doesn’t mean our members can’t get help from others, we still talk regularly and share ideas across the board to ensure we are all happy with the desired outcome.</p>
