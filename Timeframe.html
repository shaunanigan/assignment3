							<p>A realistic timeframe of what we might be able to achieve with more time on the project. Obviously it would take us a lot longer given the fact we are only 1st year students, however a group of qualified people in the area would be able to achieve all these goals a lot quicker</p>
							<p>This table is based on the idea that we are the ones completeing the project. Some of the functionality ideas would probably take a lot longer than what is written on the table, for example elements that needed coding, as we have to learn these areas before we can implement them. But this is our best guess</p>
