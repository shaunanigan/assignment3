							<h1>Risks</h1>
							 <p>There are risks that we need to consider during the development of our project. Firstly, our project requires users to post job listings on it for it to be functional. This means our application essentially relies on the users. This could be problematic because if there are no job listings, people won’t use the app and since people aren’t using the app, new listings won’t be made or be able to be filled. This is similar to a “you need experience to get experience” type scenario that occurs in the workforce for entry level positions.</p>
							 <p>Another problem we could potentially face is competition. Other very similar job searching apps and websites already exist (such as Seek, Jora Jobs, etc). Although those applications aren't geared just towards tradies, job listings in this industry are being posted daily. We need to find a way to entice people and convince them to use our application, instead of the competition, since it's superior. “small fish, big pond”</p>
							 <p>In addition, there is also the risk that the application may not be compatible with different devices. All devices are different, and run on different operating systems. Since we have a virtually zero budget, we would be unable to test the application on all different devices and operating systems, which risks potential compatibility and usability issues for devices we are unable to test on. Also, for applications to be available on the App Store, they have to be tested and approved by Apple, which could create delays in essential updates and makes it harder to test usability.</p>
							 <p>There is also the risk that, if we use a third party for web hosting and / or data storage, that there may be uptime issues and the website or application goes down unexpectedly. This can be resolved by either hosting the website and data storage on a computer that we personally have to keep up and running so all accountability is on us, but that is extremely impractical and inefficient.</p>
